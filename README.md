# German Dataset
The development of financial consumption has led to an increase in the demand for financing. <br>
Every time a bank receives a request of this kind, it activates a process
creditworthiness assessment. Its purpose is to predict whether the consumer will
capable of fulfilling their loan repayment obligation. In a preliminary phase,
the credit history of the applicant is built by combining his/her personal data and documentation
income with that present in the databases. <br> 
Through the latter the institutes are able to
identify if there are pending credits or if there have been delays in the last payments,
outlining two profiles: bad payer (if the previous hypothesis is true) or good payer. <br>
The <b>goal </b> is to understand how to minimize the issuance of risky loans while maximizing the
possibility of profiting from good loans.
